Scope of the Project
-Designed for high school students to help them understand their chances of getting into a college for their chosen major.
-The app provides the following features:
	1. Calculates the probability of admission for a specific major at a selected college based on the student's profile.
	2. Offers feedback on how to improve and fill any gaps in the application.
	3. Includes a personalized chatbot to answer custom queries.

Collie Vs ChatGPT
ðŸ§  1. Structured Input â†’ Tailored Output
-Collie collects structured data (GPA, SAT, APs, major, activities) in a guided wayâ€”ensuring complete, relevant, and context-rich inputs.
-ChatGPT alone relies on what the student remembers to share in a casual chat, often missing key details needed for accurate guidance.

ðŸ“Š 2. Focused on College Admissions
-Collie is purpose-built for evaluating admissions chances, with logic, models, and prompts designed specifically for this task.
-ChatGPT is general-purpose and lacks access to Collieâ€™s custom logic, statistical models, or databases (e.g. College Scorecard API) unless manually prompted every time.

ðŸ§­ 3. Personalized Recommendations
-Collie gives actionable feedbackâ€”like how to improve SAT scores or strengthen extracurriculars for a specific college and major.
-ChatGPT can give general advice, but it wonâ€™t automatically compare the studentâ€™s profile to school-specific benchmarks unless explicitly prompted.

ðŸ’¬ 4. Chatbot Integration Still Adds Value
-Collie includes ChatGPT as a personalized botâ€”but now it works in the context of already knowing the studentâ€™s data. This creates a smarter assistant that doesnâ€™t need to ask background questions repeatedly.

ðŸ”’ 5. Controlled Experience
-You decide how the user flows through the appâ€”limiting confusion, distraction, or off-topic questions.
-ChatGPT in raw form can veer off-topic or overwhelm students who don't know how to ask the "right" question.

âœ… Summary:
Collie turns ChatGPT into a college counselor. It enhances the experience by adding structure, focus, and intelligent customizationâ€”something that ChatGPT alone, used informally, cannot replicate as effectively.
